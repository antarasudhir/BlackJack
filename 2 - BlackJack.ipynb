    "How the game works:\n",
    "- There is one Player and one Dealer\n",
    "- The Player is asked to place their bet (the Player starts off with 100 chips and cannot place a bet higher than the amount of   chips available)\n",
    "- Two cards are dealt to both the Dealer and Player\n",
    "- When revealing the Dealer's cards, one card remains hidden, while both cards of the Player are revealed\n",
    "- The Player then makes a choice: Hit or Stand \n",
    "- If the Player's hand is a value above 21, they lose\n",
    "- If the Player's  hand is a value less than 21, then they can make another choice to Hit or Stand\n",
    "- If the Dealer's hand is 17 or more, they lose\n",
    "- After the game ends, the Player can choose whether to play again or not"
